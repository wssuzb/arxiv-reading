[Orbital and Radiative Properties of Wandering Intermediate-Mass Black Holes in the ASTRID Simulation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.16319.pdf)
- use the cosmological simulation [ASTRID](https://astrid-portal. psc.edu/) to study the orbital and radiative properties of wandering IMBHs in massive galaxies at $z\sim$  3.
- Their typical spectral energy distribution peaks in the infrared at $\sim$ 11 $\mu$m rest frame.
- These findings suggest that HLXs are a small subset of the general wandering IMBH population.

[Winds in ultraluminous X-ray sources: new challenges](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.00014.pdf)
- ULX winds to study:
	- how much and how fast can matter be accreted by compact objects？
	- how strong is their feedback onto the surrounding medium?
- An intimate connection between the wind and the source state is suggested, potentially unveiling the detailed accretion and variability mechanism.
- larger statistical sample of ULX winds?
- limited by the variability timescales that are too short to be sampled with the current instruments.

[A Black Hole Kicked At Birth: MAXI J1305-704](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.02158.pdf)
- the low-mass X-ray binary MAXI J1305-704.
- We find that if MAXI J1305-704 formed via isolated binary evolution in the thick Galactic disk, then its black hole received a natal kick of at least 70 km/s with 95% confidence.

[Once is an Instance, Twice is a Hobby: Multiple Optical and Near-Infrared Changing-Look Events in NGC 5273](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.03801.pdf)
- IR, optical, UV and X-ray data from 2000 to 2022.
- changing-look event occurred between 2011 and 2014, type 1.8/1.9 to type 1.
- In 2022, again a type 1.

[BASS XXXIX: Swift-BAT AGN with changing-look optical spectra](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.04478.pdf)
- 21 AGN from BASS are now known to display CL behaviour.
- We derive a CL rate of 0.7-6.2 per cent on 10-25 year time-scales, and show that many transitions happen within at most a few years.

[AGN quenching in simulated dwarf galaxies](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.05275.pdf)
- within the Romulus25 cosmological hydrodynamic simulation.
- Our results indicate the possibility of substantial star formation suppression via MBH feedback within dwarf galaxies in the field.

[Is the star formation rate in z ∼ 6 quasars overestimated?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.05790.pdf)
- We test the validity of this assumption by combining cosmological hydrodynamic simulations with radiative transfer calculations.
- suggesting that AGN effectively heat the bulk of dust in the host galaxy.
- We find that the SFR is overestimated by a factor of $\sim$ 3 for AGN bolometric luminosities of $L_\rm{bol}=10^{12}L_\odot$.
