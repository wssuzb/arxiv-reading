[Orbital and Radiative Properties of Wandering Intermediate-Mass Black Holes in the ASTRID Simulation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.16319.pdf)
- use the cosmological simulation [ASTRID](https://astrid-portal. psc.edu/) to study the orbital and radiative properties of wandering IMBHs in massive galaxies at $z\sim$  3.
- Their typical spectral energy distribution peaks in the infrared at $\sim$ 11 $\mu$m rest frame.
- These findings suggest that HLXs are a small subset of the general wandering IMBH population.
