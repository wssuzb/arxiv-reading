[Orbital and Radiative Properties of Wandering Intermediate-Mass Black Holes in the ASTRID Simulation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.16319.pdf)
- use the cosmological simulation [ASTRID](https://astrid-portal. psc.edu/) to study the orbital and radiative properties of wandering IMBHs in massive galaxies at $z\sim$  3.
- Their typical spectral energy distribution peaks in the infrared at $\sim$ 11 $\mu$m rest frame.
- These findings suggest that HLXs are a small subset of the general wandering IMBH population.

[Winds in ultraluminous X-ray sources: new challenges](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.00014.pdf)
- ULX winds to study:
	- how much and how fast can matter be accreted by compact objectsï¼Ÿ
	- how strong is their feedback onto the surrounding medium?
- An intimate connection between the wind and the source state is suggested, potentially unveiling the detailed accretion and variability mechanism.
- larger statistical sample of ULX winds?
- limited by the variability timescales that are too short to be sampled with the current instruments.
