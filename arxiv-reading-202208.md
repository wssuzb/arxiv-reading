 [Hengxiao Guo et al., 2022-AGN Continuum Reverberation Mapping Based on Zwicky Transient Facility Light Curves](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.06432.pdf)
- 94 type 1 AGN at $z$ < 0.8.
- interpolated cross-correlation function & JAVELIN.
- main findings:
	- disk size *larger* than disk model.
	- CE size scales with continuum luminosity.
	- black hole mass might biased.

 [Gaskell_2022_Estimating reddening of the continuum and broad-line region of active galactic nuclei- the mean reddening of NGC 5548 and the size of the accretion disc](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11437)
- estimate broad-line and continuum **reddenings** of NGC 5548.
- UV-to-optical ratios rule out a steep SMC-like reddening curve for NGC 5548.
- interesting findings:
	- the accretion disk size discrepancy is primarily due to the neglect of reddening? (also see Gaskell et al., 2017).

[Buitrago_2022_Revisiting the Continuum Reverberation Lags in the AGN PKS 0558âˆ’504.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.02474.pdf)
- Gliozzi et al., 2013 having interchanged the order of the driving and responding light curves when measuring the lags.
- new findings:
	- short-wavelength continuum variations leading the longer one.

[Pflugradt_2022_Finding of a population of active galactic nuclei showing a significant luminosity decline in the past $\sim10^{3-4}$ yrs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.12286.pdf)
- AGN subclass
	- strong activity at large scales ($\sim$1 kpc), weaker at small scales (< 10 pc).
	- strong change in the mass accretion rate of central engine.
- declining or fading AGN, cross-matching the SDSS type-1 AGN catalog, $z < 0.4$
- [Oiii]$\lambda5007$ emission line -> NLR emission.
- 57 of 7653 AGNs, $L_{bol}$ (from MIR) one order of magnitude fainter than from [Oiii]$\lambda5007$ emission line.

[Akylas_2022_Black hole mass estimation using X-ray variability measurements in Seyfert galaxies](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.12490.pdf)
- estimate the black hole mass via X-ray, i.e., **the normalised excess variance from X-ray**.
- minimum requirements of light-curve duration and X-ray S/N.
	- $\sim3$ for S/N and 80-100 ks for duration.
- NuSTAR, normalised excess variance ($\sigma^2_{NXV}$) in 3-10 and 10-20 keV.
- lineaer relationship, 0.4-0.25 dex uncertainty.

- forward Monte Carlo model for forecasting the population of AGNs in dwarf galaxies via optical variability.
- LSST, hourly cadence can constrain the IMBH mass.
