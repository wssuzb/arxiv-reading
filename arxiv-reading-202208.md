 [Gaskell_2022_Estimating reddening of the continuum and broad-line region of active galactic nuclei- the mean reddening of NGC 5548 and the size of the accretion disc](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11437)
- estimate broad-line and continuum **reddenings** of NGC 5548.
- UV-to-optical ratios rule out a steep SMC-like reddening curve for NGC 5548.
- interesting findings:
	- the accretion disk size discrepancy is primarily due to the neglect of reddening? (also see Gaskell et al., 2017).

- Gliozzi et al., 2013 having interchanged the order of the driving and responding light curves when measuring the lags.
- new findings:
	- short-wavelength continuum variations leading the longer one.

[Pflugradt_2022_Finding of a population of active galactic nuclei showing a significant luminosity decline in the past $\sim10^{3-4}$ yrs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.12286.pdf)
- AGN subclass
	- strong activity at large scales ($\sim$1 kpc), weaker at small scales (< 10 pc).
	- strong change in the mass accretion rate of central engine.
- declining or fading AGN, cross-matching the SDSS type-1 AGN catalog, $z < 0.4$
- [Oiii]$\lambda5007$ emission line -> NLR emission.
- 57 of 7653 AGNs, $L_{bol}$ (from MIR) one order of magnitude fainter than from [Oiii]$\lambda5007$ emission line.

[Akylas_2022_Black hole mass estimation using X-ray variability measurements in Seyfert galaxies](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.12490.pdf)
- estimate the black hole mass via X-ray, i.e., **the normalised excess variance from X-ray**.
- minimum requirements of light-curve duration and X-ray S/N.
	- $\sim3$ for S/N and 80-100 ks for duration.
- NuSTAR, normalised excess variance ($\sigma^2_{NXV}$) in 3-10 and 10-20 keV.
- lineaer relationship, 0.4-0.25 dex uncertainty.

- variability of near-infrared coronal lines.
- one-year long spectroscopic monitoring, weekly cadence.
	- emission line fluxes and profile shapes.
	- coronal lines broader than the low-ionisation forbidden lines and blueshifted.

[Looking at Radio-Quiet AGN with Radio Polarimetry](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.03877.pdf)
- radio emission mechanism in radio-quasars (RQQS) is and open question.
	- low-power radio jets, winds, sf and coronal emission.
- radio polarization and emission-line can help to distinguish between these scenarios
- anti-correlation between polarized radio emission and [O iii] emission

- Wide Field Slitless Spectroscopy (WFSS), SFGs (without the need for target pre-selection).
- GLASS-JWST-ERS program
	- NIRISS, $z \sim3.4$

- strong correlation between the measured H$\beta$ and [Oiii]$\lambda5007$ EWs,
	- high $\lambda5007$ EW require massive stars in young stellar pop, generate the high energy photons.
