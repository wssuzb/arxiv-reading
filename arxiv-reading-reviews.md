- ongoing searches for intermediate-mass black holes with $M_{\rm{BH}}\approx10-10^5M_\odot$.
- no solid detections of black holes in globular clusters.
- current status:
	- extending scaling relations? black hole number densities?
	- how emission from accretion flows onto BH will evolve with BH mass?
		- lower mass, accretion disk gets hotter, bolometric luminosity drops -> look like XRB (Cann et al., 2019).
	- the community has recognized the significant challenge of creating such massive black holes so quickly? (see: [[arxiv-reading-202209#Sep 22]]) #thoughts
	- dwarf galaxies, suffer **fewer mergers and less accretion**.
	- Einstein Telescope, the first ULXs,
		- high X-ray luminosities are powered by IMBHs. (?)
- formation of BH seed:
	- Pop III stars, quite massive, due to the inability of molecular hydrogen gas to cool.
	- collapse gas clouds forming a massive seed black hole without passing through all the phases of stellar evolution.
		- **only at very high redshift**, because pristine gas is required to suppress cooling and fragmentation.
	- a gravitational runaway event within a dense stellar cluster.
