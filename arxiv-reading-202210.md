[X-ray and radio observations of central black holes in nearby low-mass early-type galaxies: Preliminary evidence for low Eddington fractions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.15015.pdf)
- new radio and X-ray observations of two nearby (< 4Mpc): NGC 5102, NGC 205.
- the mean ratio of bolometric to Eddington luminosity in this sample is only log ($L_{\rm{bol}}/L_{\rm{Edd}}$) = −6.57 $\pm$ 0.50.
- If it is confirmed that central black holes in low-mass galaxies typically have low Eddington ratios.
- a challenge to measuring the occupation fraction of central black holes with standard optical emission line, X-ray, or radio surveys?

[The Relation between the Optical Fe II Emission and the Dimensionless Accretion Rate for Active Galactic Nuclei](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.00684.pdf)
- optical Fe ii emission has a connection with the accretion process.
- 4037 quasars ($z<0.8$) with H$\beta$ line (SDSS) and 120 RM AGN.
- find a strong correlation between the relative optical Fe II strength $R_{\rm{Fe}}$ and $\dot{M}$ for the SDSS subsample with the Spearman correlation coefficient $r_s$ of 0.727.

#accretion #corona #interesting 

[The σHβ-based dimensionless accretion rate and its connection with the corona for AGN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.01316.pdf)
- It is found that there exists a non-linear relationship between the Eddington ratio ($L_{\rm{Bol}}/L_{\rm{Edd}}$) and $\dot{M}$ , i.e., $L_{\rm{Bol}}/L_{\rm{Edd}}\sim\dot{M}^{0.56\pm 0.01}$ .
- This non-linear relationship comes from the accretion efficiency $\eta$.
- We ﬁnd a strong bivariate correlation of the fraction of energy released in the corona $F_X$ with $\dot{M}$ and $M_{BH}$ , $F_X\propto\dot{M}^{−0.57\pm 0.05}M_{BH}^{−0.54\pm 0.06}$.

[X-ray Reverberation Mapping of Ark 564 using Gaussian Process Regression](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.01810.pdf)
- Ark 564 is an extreme high-Eddington Narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy.
- brightest, most rapidly variable soft X-ray AGN, and for having one of the lowest temperature coronae.
- a 410 ks NuSTAR observation + two 115 ks XMM-Newton observations.
- Fourier-resolved time lags + Gaussian processes to interpolate the NuSTAR gaps ([pylag](https://github.com/wilkinsdr/pylag)).
- machine learning + Fourier-resolved timing + reverberation models.

[The Assembly of Black Hole Mass and Luminosity Functions of High-redshift Quasars via Multiple Accretion Episodes](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.02308.pdf)
- we construct the QLF and BHMF of the early BH population that experiences multiple accretion bursts, in each of which a constant Eddington ratio is assigned following a Schechter distribution function.
- suggests that several episodes of moderate super-Eddington accretion occur and each of them lasts for τ ' 20 − 30 Myr.
- We find that the observed Eddington-ratio distribution function is skewed to a log-normal shape owing to detection limits of quasar surveys.

[Quashing a suspected selection bias in galaxy samples having dynamically-measured supermassive black holes](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.02641.pdf)
- check using galaxies common to the Spitzer Survey of Stellar Structure in Galaxies (S4G) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS).
- $\sigma-M$ diagram.
- We find that the stellar masses of galaxies with and without directly measured black holes had appeared offset from each other due to the use of inconsistent stellar mass-to-light ratios, $\gamma_∗$, for the optical and infrared data.

[Demographics of 𝑧 ∼ 6 Quasars in the Black Hole Mass-Luminosity Plane](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.02518.pdf)
- sample: $5.7 < z < 6.5$, 100 quasars.
- forward modeling of BH masses and Eddington ratios, sample flux limits and uncertainties.
- provide reliable constraints on the $z\sim 6$ black hole mass function at $M_{\rm{BH}}>10^{8.5}M_\odot$.
- We also find that, at $4.5 < z < 6$, the number densities of more massive BHs tend to decline more rapidly with increasing redshift, contrary to the trend at $2.5<z<4.5$ reported previously.

[Torus and polar dust dependence on AGN properties](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.03508.pdf)
- We find that the smooth, clumpy and two-phase torus models and disc+wind models provide best fits for a comparable number of galaxies.
- We fitted for the first time the nuclear IR SEDs (∼1-30 $\mu$m) obtained with high angular resolution data with six different torus models to find the model that most closely reproduces the nuclear IR SEDs of type 1 and 2 Seyfert galaxies.

#variability #psd #sf #agn 

[Optical variability of eight FRII-type quasars with 13-yr photometric light curves](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.04058.pdf)
- PSDs show a good fit to single power law forms, indicating a red-noise character of variability between $\sim$ 13 years and weeks timescales.
- The absence of bends in the PSDs (change of slope from $\geq$ 1 to $\sim$ 0) on longer timescales indicates that optical variations are most likely caused by thermal instabilities in the accretion disk.

[Intranight optical variability of low-mass Active Galactic Nuclei: A Pointer to blazar-like activity](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.05186.pdf)
- intranight optical variability (INOV) of LMAGN.
- 36 session campaign of intranight optical monitoring of 12 LMAGNs.
- exhibit INOV at a level statistically comparable to that observed for blazars ($M_{\rm{BH}} > 10^{8-9} M_\odot$) and $\gamma$-ray NLS1 ($M_{\rm{BH}}\sim 10^{7}M_\odot$).
- blazar-level activity can even be sustained by central engines with black holes near the upper limit for IMBHs.
