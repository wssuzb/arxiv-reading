[X-ray and radio observations of central black holes in nearby low-mass early-type galaxies: Preliminary evidence for low Eddington fractions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.15015.pdf)
- new radio and X-ray observations of two nearby (< 4Mpc): NGC 5102, NGC 205.
- the mean ratio of bolometric to Eddington luminosity in this sample is only log ($L_{\rm{bol}}/L_{\rm{Edd}}$) = ‚àí6.57 $\pm$ 0.50.
- If it is confirmed that central black holes in low-mass galaxies typically have low Eddington ratios.
- a challenge to measuring the occupation fraction of central black holes with standard optical emission line, X-ray, or radio surveys?

#accretion #corona #interesting 

[The œÉHŒ≤-based dimensionless accretion rate and its connection with the corona for AGN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.01316.pdf)
- It is found that there exists a non-linear relationship between the Eddington ratio ($L_{\rm{Bol}}/L_{\rm{Edd}}$) and $\dot{M}$ , i.e., $L_{\rm{Bol}}/L_{\rm{Edd}}\sim\dot{M}^{0.56\pm 0.01}$ .
- This non-linear relationship comes from the accretion efficiency $\eta$.
- We Ô¨Ånd a strong bivariate correlation of the fraction of energy released in the corona $F_X$ with $\dot{M}$ and $M_{BH}$ , $F_X\propto\dot{M}^{‚àí0.57\pm 0.05}M_{BH}^{‚àí0.54\pm 0.06}$.

[The Assembly of Black Hole Mass and Luminosity Functions of High-redshift Quasars via Multiple Accretion Episodes](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.02308.pdf)
- we construct the QLF and BHMF of the early BH population that experiences multiple accretion bursts, in each of which a constant Eddington ratio is assigned following a Schechter distribution function.
- suggests that several episodes of moderate super-Eddington accretion occur and each of them lasts for œÑ ' 20 ‚àí 30 Myr.
- We find that the observed Eddington-ratio distribution function is skewed to a log-normal shape owing to detection limits of quasar surveys.

[Quashing a suspected selection bias in galaxy samples having dynamically-measured supermassive black holes](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.02641.pdf)
- check using galaxies common to the Spitzer Survey of Stellar Structure in Galaxies (S4G) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS).
- $\sigma-M$ diagram.
- We find that the stellar masses of galaxies with and without directly measured black holes had appeared offset from each other due to the use of inconsistent stellar mass-to-light ratios, $\gamma_‚àó$, for the optical and infrared data.

[Demographics of ùëß ‚àº 6 Quasars in the Black Hole Mass-Luminosity Plane](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.02518.pdf)
- sample: $5.7 < z < 6.5$, 100 quasars.
- forward modeling of BH masses and Eddington ratios, sample flux limits and uncertainties.
- provide reliable constraints on the $z\sim 6$ black hole mass function at $M_{\rm{BH}}>10^{8.5}M_\odot$.
- We also find that, at $4.5 < z < 6$, the number densities of more massive BHs tend to decline more rapidly with increasing redshift, contrary to the trend at $2.5<z<4.5$ reported previously.

- We find that the smooth, clumpy and two-phase torus models and disc+wind models provide best fits for a comparable number of galaxies.
- We fitted for the first time the nuclear IR SEDs (‚àº1-30 $\mu$m) obtained with high angular resolution data with six different torus models to find the model that most closely reproduces the nuclear IR SEDs of type 1 and 2 Seyfert galaxies.

#variability #psd #sf #agn 

[Optical variability of eight FRII-type quasars with 13-yr photometric light curves](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.04058.pdf)
- PSDs show a good fit to single power law forms, indicating a red-noise character of variability between $\sim$ 13 years and weeks timescales.
- The absence of bends in the PSDs (change of slope from $\geq$ 1 to $\sim$ 0) on longer timescales indicates that optical variations are most likely caused by thermal instabilities in the accretion disk.

#bass #eddington-ratio #agn 

[Probing the Structure and Evolution of BASS AGN through Eddington Ratios](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.08401.pdf)
- constrain the $\lambda_{\rm{Edd}}$ , Swift-BAT/BASS DR2 survey.
- at low Eddington ratios (log $\lambda_{\rm{Edd}}$ < ‚àí2), obscured AGN outnumber unobscured ones by a factor of $\sim$ 4.
- At high Eddington ratios (log $\lambda_{\rm{Edd}}$ > ‚àí1), we suggest is mainly due to the small fraction of time spent in a highly obscured state.
- We find that the low fraction of obscured AGN at high ŒªEdd is primarily due to the fact that the covering factor drops very rapidly, with more than half the time spent with < 10% covering factor.
- We also find that nearly all obscured AGN at high-ŒªEdd exhibit some broad-lines. 

#dust #nlr #sed 

[Polar Dust Emission in Quasar IR SEDs and Its Correlation with Narrow Line Regions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.08037.pdf)
- We report correlations between the prominence of AGN forbidden line emission (commonly associated with the narrow line region) and the dust mid-IR energy (PG quasar, SDSS, Spitzer, WISE).
- These observations indicate that, where the lines are strong, a large fraction of the AGN emission at Œª $\gtrsim$ 5 ¬µm comes from dust in the forbidden line regions.
- The association of polar dust with the forbidden lines suggests an alternative to the receding torus hypothesis for the decrease in infrared output with increasing AGN luminosity.
