[X-ray and radio observations of central black holes in nearby low-mass early-type galaxies: Preliminary evidence for low Eddington fractions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.15015.pdf)
- new radio and X-ray observations of two nearby (< 4Mpc): NGC 5102, NGC 205.
- the mean ratio of bolometric to Eddington luminosity in this sample is only log ($L_{\rm{bol}}/L_{\rm{Edd}}$) = âˆ’6.57 $\pm$ 0.50.
- If it is confirmed that central black holes in low-mass galaxies typically have low Eddington ratios.
- a challenge to measuring the occupation fraction of central black holes with standard optical emission line, X-ray, or radio surveys?

[Revealing AGNs Through TESS Variability](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.15019.pdf)
- TESS data to identify 29 candidata AGN, through variability.
- 8 of the 29 candidates have estimated black hole masses $\leq 10^6M_{\odot}$.
- NGC 4395 and NGC 4449 high-confidence.
