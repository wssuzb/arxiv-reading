[The need for obscured supermassive black hole growth to explain quasar proximity zones in the epoch of reionization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.08103.pdf)
- proximity zones (pz) of quasars -> probe the SMBH, how to explain the pz size and black hole masses?
- the short equilibration time of gas inside the proximity zones, small proximity zones can be readily explained by quasars that vary in brightness.
- reconciling this with black hole mass estimates requires the black hole to continue to grow and accrete during its obscured phase
- high-redshift proximity zones can be an effective tool to study quasar variability and black hole growth.
